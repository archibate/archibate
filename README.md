### Hi there 👋 This is 彭于斌!

I make elegantly robust **💻 computer graphics and 🐧 operating system** wheels for fun. 🌈  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [ZENO](https://github.com/zenustech/zeno), a node system framework for simulation.
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching a [public course](https://github.com/parallel101/course) on parallel programming in C++17.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on physics simulation developers.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with who could be my teacher assistant.
- 🎓 I'm a college student major in software engineering :)
- 💬 Ask me about computer graphics and modern C++ tips & tricks.
- 📫 How to reach me: archibate@foxmail.com or [Bilibili message](https://space.bilibili.com/263032155/).
- 😄 Pronouns: he, she, you, me, I, we, us, this, them, that.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a remote employee from Shanghai to Shenzhen :)
- 🕵 Take a look at my repositories and let's get in touch!
- 🎵 By the way, I love music, so I'm a big fan of HarumakiGohan!
